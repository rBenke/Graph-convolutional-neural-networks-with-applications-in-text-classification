## BBC text categorization
>Text documents are one of the richest sources of data for businesses.
>
>Weâ€™ll use a public dataset from the BBC comprised of 2225 articles, each labeled under one of 5 categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport or tech.
>
>The dataset is broken into 1490 records for training and 735 for testing. The goal will be to build a system that can accurately classify previously unseen news articles into the right category.
>
>The competition is evaluated using Accuracy as a metric.

## Repository description
Steps for reproducing the results:
* run the data/load_raw_data.ipynb -- it will create a feather file with all the documents in single dataframe and download the word2vec model.
* TextGCN:
    * prepare the heterogenous word-document graph for the whole corpus with TextGCN/text2graph.ipynb
    * learn the model and make predictions with TextGCN/TextGCN.ipynb
* DocumentGCN
    * prepare the graph for every document in the corpus with DocumentGCN/text2graphs.ipynb
    * learn the model and make predictions with DocumentGCN/DocumentGCN.ipynb
* Non-graph-oriented models are contained in the NB&DNN folder.
