## BBC text categorization
>Text documents are one of the richest sources of data for businesses.
>
>Weâ€™ll use a public dataset from the BBC comprised of 2225 articles, each labeled under one of 5 categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport or tech.
>
>The dataset is broken into 1490 records for training and 735 for testing. The goal will be to build a system that can accurately classify previously unseen news >articles into the right category.
>
>The competition is evaluated using Accuracy as a metric.
